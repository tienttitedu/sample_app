# Ruby on Rails Tutorial sample application

This is the sample application for

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
 $ rails generate controller StaticPages home help
  $ rails destroy  controller StaticPages home help
Similarly, in Chapter 6 weâ€™ll generate a model as follows:

  $ rails generate model User name:string email:string
This can be undone using

  $ rails destroy model User
(In this case, it turns out we can omit the other command-line arguments. When you get to Chapter 6, see if you can figure out why.)

Another technique related to models involves undoing migrations, which we saw briefly in Chapter 2 and will see much more of starting in Chapter 6. Migrations change the state of the database using the command

  $ rails db:migrate
We can undo a single migration step using

  $ rails db:rollback
To go all the way back to the beginning, we can use

  $ rails db:migrate VERSION=0
